# WWDC2022 Listen Your Artwork

## “Listen Your Artwork!!!”

  The best way to experience it is through synesthesia. In the art world, fine arts and music are not different. You have to see these in the same way.
This app is created so that anyone and everyone can easily experience music and the fine arts through a synesthetic experience. Therefore, the app contains three essential features.
  First, creating new shapes. Users are able to create articles by choosing colors and arts on the left menu bar. 
  Next, users can drag, rotate and resize the articles to fill the canvas with their artwork.
  The last feature is the unique feature of this app: the combination of visual and musical art. When pressing the play button on the menu, piano chords will play in harmony with the visual artwork. This is made possible by applying different codes to different shapes. 
  The main technology used in “Listen Your Art” is gesture and AVAudioPlayer. Moreover, various instrumentals and design elements are planned to be updated later. 
  Music and the fine arts are never difficult. Let's create wonderful artworks easily through synesthesia!
